# Monthly Coding Challenge

## **Abstract**

Every month I select a subject (or a theme) I wish to work on and try to find projects that will improve my knowledge on it.  


## **The Game Plan**

1. Every projects must have a link to the monthly theme. They don't need to be very polished as long as the main concept is here.

2. Any *crazy* idea is fine. We do not care if it's a viable idea or not.  
The most important thing is to have fun and learn something in the process.

3. Any programming language will do.  
This way we can refresh some old languages and learn new ones.
