## **Abstract**

The goal of the Monthly Coding Challenge is to find, design and develop an idea in only one month.  

## **The Game Plan**

1. The challenge must be completed in one month and one month only.  
If at the end of the month the project is not finished, so be it.  
This force us to focus on what is only necessary and leave out the rest.

2. Any *crazy* idea is fine. We do not care if it's a viable idea or not.  
The most important thing is to have fun and learn something in the process.

3. Any programming language will do.  
I'm planning to do Python, Rust and C++. Maybe NodeJS/Typescript as well.  
That will be good to improve new language or refresh some old ones.


## **The projects**

All the projects and a link to their respective directory in the repo will be listed here.
